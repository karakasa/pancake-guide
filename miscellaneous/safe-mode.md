# Safe Mode

In the unlikely scenario when Pancake leads Grasshopper to crash and lose responsiveness on startup, Safe Mode prevent all 'continuous' features from loading.

### How to use this feature?

* Hold Shift Key \(any if there is more than one\) during the Grasshopper "Loading" screen

### What will be disabled, exactly?

* Hang Protection
  * You cannot do hot-switch, either.
* File Block Monitor
  * Pancake will still check blocks when this feature is turned on. But the 'monitor' part is entirely disabled.
* Distributed Computing
  * Debug mode will be enabled.

### What else should I also notice?

* The menu is `Pancake [Safemode]` instead of regular `Pancake` if safe mode is enabled.
