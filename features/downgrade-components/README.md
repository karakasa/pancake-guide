# Downgrade Components

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature works differently if you are using Rhino 5, click [here](downgrade-components-rhino-5.md) for more information.
{% endhint %}

The Grasshopper shipped with Rhinoceros 6 introduces a bunch of new components, some replacing the most basic ones. This feature provides an one-click solution for downgrading them, so that it can be loaded by a Rhino 5 user.

### How to use this feature?

* Navigate to "Pancake" menu, click "Downgrade components to Rhino 5 version"

### Which component will be downgraded?

* Subtraction \(with 2 inputs\)
* Multiplication \(with 2 inputs\)
* Evaluate Surface
* Interpolate Curve \(Tangent\)
* Relay component

### What if I use some component unavailable in Rhino 5?

Pancake will notify you about these components, and only operate on downgradable ones.
