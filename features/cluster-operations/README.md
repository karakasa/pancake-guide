# Cluster Operations

Clustert is an important part of Grasshopper, though sometimes a cluster feature \(e.g. Selection to Cluster, Modify Cluster Hook\) wouldn't work as expected. Pancake provides several tools to adjust behaviors.

### How to use this feature?

* Navigate to "Pancake" menu, click "Cluster Operation", and choose the function you need to use.
* Refer to child pages for detailed information
