# Welcome!

### What is Pancake and What is this site?

Pancake is an actively developing plugin that helps with smoother Grasshopper experience and team cooperation. You can download it [here](http://www.food4rhino.com/app/pancake). We encourage you to use the latest version as it provides more features and better stablity.

This site is an online manual of Pancake. Due to the rapid iteration nature, the content here may only apply to the latest version.

### Is Pancake free?

Absolutely. Pancake is a freeware licensed for both non-commercial and commercial use. Feel free to contact the developer. However, support might be limited. We provide paid customizable version.

### Why doesn't it work?

Reason varies. First, it requires at least .NET framework 4.5, which is shipped with Rhinoceros 6 but not with Rhino 5. If you encounter "load failure" messages, check the .NET framework downloader [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653). For other problems, please visit [Troubleshoot](troubleshoot.md) page.
